# Quiz App with MongoDB Integration

A simple quiz application with user authentication and MongoDB integration.

## Features

- User registration and login with MongoDB
- Multiple quiz categories (Football, Basketball, Cricket)
- Timed questions with score tracking
- Results page showing final score

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB installed and running locally

## Setup and Running

### 1. Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine. The default connection URL is:
```
mongodb://localhost:27017/quizapp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Backend Server

```bash
# From the backend directory
npm run dev
```

The backend server will start on http://localhost:5001

### 4. Run the Frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
# From the root directory
npm start
```

The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000

## How to Use

1. Register a new account on the signup page (4-digit numeric password required)
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Select a quiz category from the home page
4. Read the rules and click Start Quiz
5. Answer the questions within the 10-second time limit
6. View your final score on the results page

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
